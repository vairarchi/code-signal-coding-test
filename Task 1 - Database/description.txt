When people fly long distances, a direct city-to-city flight is often more expensive than taking two flights with a stop in a hub city. Travelers might save even more money by breaking the trip into three flights with two stops. But for the purposes of this challenge, let's assume that no one is willing to stop three times!

You have a table with individual airport-to-airport flights, which contains the following columns:

id - the unique ID of the flight;
origin - the origin city of the current flight;
destination - the destination city of the current flight;
cost - the cost of current flight.
The cities are all represented by an abbreviation composed of three uppercase English letters.
Your task is to write a select statement that lists all the cheapest possible trips that can be done in two or fewer stops. The output should have columns origin, destination, stops (indicating the number of stops in current trip), and total_cost.

If two trips cost the same but have a different number of stops, include the one with the fewest stops. Sort the output table by origin, then by destination.

Note: A flight from SFO to JFK is considered to be different than a flight from JFK to SFO.

Example

For given table flights

id	origin	destination	cost
1	SFO	JFK	500
2	SFO	DFW	200
3	SFO	MCO	400
4	DFW	MCO	100
5	DFW	JFK	200
6	JFK	LHR	1000
the output should be

origin	destination	stops	total_cost
DFW	JFK	0	200
DFW	LHR	1	1200
DFW	MCO	0	100
JFK	LHR	0	1000
SFO	DFW	0	200
SFO	JFK	1	400
SFO	LHR	2	1400
SFO	MCO	1	300
